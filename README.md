# Recipe Project
In this project, we were tasked with the objective of organizing data and the worldâ€™s information and making it universally accessible and useful. 
We plan to create a cooking recipe website that allows cooks to find homemade/existing recipes and get the ingredients they need to make homemade meals
while being sheltered in place. Key features include:

- Easy to navigate home page for finding new recipes faster
- Quick search to find tagged posts for a variety of types of food
- Finding grocery stores around you to get access to all the ingredients you will need
- Uploading new recipes
- Commenting on and rating existing recipes
- An easy flow and navigation that is straightforward to discourage excessive information
- Creation of a wishlist for recipes you want to try and shopping cart for ingredients you need to get
